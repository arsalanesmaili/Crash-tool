Using this tool, users can choose the year of the accident as a single year or a span of years. They can also select the type and severity of crashes. With these filters, users can easily visualize different types of crashes in various years by combining these filters.

In this application, we have designed two maps that allow users to explore the geographical distribution of traffic collisions throughout Seattle. The first map provides users with the total number of crashes in different census tracts of Seattle. The number of crashes for this map can be normalized using population and area. The second map shows an interactive heatmap that can provide more detailed information about the location of crashes. When users zoom in, the map can provide the location of crashes in a more detailed manner.

Another feature of our application presents a map that visualizes the density of traffic collisions in Seattle. This heatmap is particularly useful for identifying the city's most hazardous areas, tailored to specific levels of severity and types of crashes. Moreover, this Streamlit application provides various plots and percentages that help users explore the distribution of crashes across various dimensions, including times of the day, months, days of the week, weather conditions, lighting conditions, road surface conditions, under-influenced crashes, crashes involved in speeding, and crash location types. Users have the flexibility to filter the crash data by collision type, severity level, and the specific time range they are interested in investigating.

By developing an interactive platform using Streamlit, we provide a tool for policymakers and professionals to visualize and interact with the data, facilitating informed decision-making and the development of targeted safety interventions. This study underscores the need for enhanced safety measures and infrastructure improvements to protect all road users, particularly the most vulnerable, aligning with Seattle's Vision Zero goal to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries by 2030.""",unsafe_allow_html=True)
