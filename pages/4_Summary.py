st.markdown("""This study explores the significant factors influencing the frequency and severity of traffic accidents in Seattle, using data from the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) covering 2004 to 2023. Through various visualization techniques and statistical modeling, we analyze the distribution of crashes across different conditions and examine the role of specific variables such as lighting, weather, and road surface conditions on crash severity. Our analysis reveals a significant decrease in the total number of accidents over the years, with a notable increase in the proportion of serious injury and fatal crashes. The research highlights the disproportionate impact of traffic accidents on vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists. By developing an interactive platform using Streamlit, we provide a tool for policymakers and professionals to visualize and interact with the data, facilitating informed decision-making and the development of targeted safety interventions. This study underscores the need for enhanced safety measures and infrastructure improvements to protect all road users, particularly the most vulnerable, aligning with Seattle's Vision Zero goal to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries by 2030.""",unsafe_allow_html=True)
